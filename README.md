# Jitterbugpair-SideStore-Automater
A work-in-progress batch script to help automate generating a pairing file to use with SideStore. Requires [Jitterbugpair](https://github.com/osy/Jitterbug).

## Instructions
1) [Download Jitterbugpair from its official repo](https://github.com/osy/Jitterbug/releases/download/v1.3.1/jitterbugpair-win64.zip). You will only need Jitterbugpair.
2) Unzip the `jitterbugpair-win64.zip` zip file you just downloaded.
3) Open the `jitterbugpair-win64` folder you just unzipped.
4) Download [SideStoreJitterbugPair.bat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlyatBeauty/Jitterbugpair-SideStore-Automater/main/SideStoreJitterbugPair.bat) and place it in the `jitterbugpair-win64` folder.
5) Connect your iPhone/iPad to your PC via USB cable, and leave it unlocked.
6) Run `SideStoreJitterbugPair.bat` and follow the on-screen prompts.

**Good luck!**

## Troubleshooting
1) Make sure the script is placed directly in your `jitterbugpair-win64` folder. If it is in a subfolder, the script will not run correctly.
2) If Jitterbugpair is not finding your device, make sure you have iTunes installed on your PC and that it can find and connect to your iPhone/iPad. iTunes installs the drivers necessary for Jitterbugapir to communicate with your iDevice.
3) My antivirus flagged the bat script! 

Some antivirus software may not let you download and run bat scripts directly off of the internet. The easiest solution is to copy the [raw text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlyatBeauty/Jitterbugpair-SideStore-Automater/main/SideStoreJitterbugPair.bat) into Notepad on your system, then save it as a bat script - effectively making it local to your machine.

## Issues
This script is a work-in-progress! If you run into issues, please let me know by creating an issue and I'll try to help as soon as I can!
